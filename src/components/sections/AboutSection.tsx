                    The Walk of Life is a community-driven healing tool that helps individuals connect with their ancestors, understand their past, and share their stories in a supportive environment. Inspired by ancient traditions and modern approaches, The Walk of Life allows us to explore our lives through the symbolism of the healing circleâ€”a journey from ancestors to elders.
